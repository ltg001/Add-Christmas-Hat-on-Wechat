You can login your Wechat account and it can generate a photo with a Christmas Hat at the appropriate position (probably) once receiving a message(photo)

Thanks Liuxiaolong19920720 for the implementation of the add_hat algorithm  
The original repo is here

You can download a trained facial shape predictor from http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
And of course it is needed. Just put it in the folder.
